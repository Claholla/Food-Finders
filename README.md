# Food Finders

## Description

This application allows the user to search a server-side database (through Edamam) for succinct recipes and drink recipes through another server-side API. The user is able to determine the nature of the search through an array of 2 buttons on the main index page and that controls the content that the search bar will yield on the results page. The user's search history is saved to localStorage and the user is able to call upon previous searches through the dropdown in the search bar menu with autofill options.

## Motivation/User Story

As a consumer of food and drinks I want to either search for a randomized or specified food option so that I am not struggling with the decision of picking out a meal. When it comes to human nature, food and drinks are necessary for human survival. While for some it may be easy to acquire a meal or beverage they find satisfying, others struggle daily to decide what to eat or even how to make it. With these issues in mind our team has developed a webpage to help any consumer in need of a food or drink recipe, whether it be specific to their needs or randomized for ease of choice, our website is built to handle those issues while bringing functionality and visual satisfaction to the user.

## Process 
#### Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bulma
- APIâ€™s (The CockTailDB & EDAMAM)
- Google Fonts

#### Breakdown of roles and tasks
- Front-end: Sarah Siegel
- Back-end: Clay Holland
- README: Sarah Siegel & Clay Holland
- Presentation: Sarah Siegel & Clay Holland

#### Challenges
Figuring out exactly what we wanted to do in terms of the web page itself as well as what functionality we wanted to incorporate within it.

#### Successes
Providing the functionality to search through each API and calling either a specified or randomized food/drink item based on what the user selected. 

## Directions for Future Development
- Link video tutorials for recipes for both food and/or drink options.
- Add maps options to local restaurants that match the food choice and/or drink choice.
- Have options for more specific diets such as gluten free, vegan,  vegetarian, etc.
- Find food delivery services that could pick up specified meals selected from local restaurants for consumers who are unable to leave their residence.
