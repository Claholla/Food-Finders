# Food Finders

This application allows the user to search a server-side database (through Edamam) for succinct recipes and drink recipes through another server-side API. The user is able to determine the nature of the search through an array of 2 buttons on the main index page and that controls the content that the search bar will yield on the results page. The user's search history is saved to localStorage and the user is able to call upon previous searches through the dropdown in the search bar menu with autofill options.

Software contributors include GitHub users: Claholla, and Sarasieg.
